# IMPLEMENTATION OF SYMBOL TABLE 
## Register Number : 212223230114
## Date : 17.08.2024

## AIM   
To write a C program to implement a symbol table.

## ALGORITHM
1.	Start the program.
2.	Get the input from the user with the terminating symbol ‘$’.
3.	Allocate memory for the variable by dynamic memory allocation function.
4.	If the next character of the symbol is an operator then only the memory is allocated.
5.	While reading, the input symbol is inserted into symbol table along with its memory address.
6.	The steps are repeated till ‘$’ is reached.
7.	To reach a variable, enter the variable to be searched and symbol table has been checked for corresponding variable, the variable along with its address is displayed as result.
8.	Stop the program. 

## PROGRAM
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define MAX_EXPRESSION_SIZE 100

int main()
{
    int i = 0, j = 0, x = 0, n, flag = 0;
    void *add[5];  // To store addresses of dynamically allocated memory
    char b[MAX_EXPRESSION_SIZE], d[15], c, srch;

    printf("Enter the Expression terminated by $: ");
    // Read the expression until '$' or max limit is reached
    while ((c = getchar()) != '$' && i < MAX_EXPRESSION_SIZE - 1) {
        b[i++] = c;
    }
    b[i] = '\0'; // Null terminate the string
    n = i;       // n is the length of the string, excluding '$'

    printf("Given Expression: %s\n", b);

    printf("\nSymbol Table\n");
    printf("Symbol\taddr\t\t\ttype\n");

    // Scan through the expression and identify symbols
    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        c = b[j];
        if (isalpha((unsigned char)c)) {  // If the character is an alphabet (identifier)
            if (j == n - 1 || strchr("+-*=/%", b[j + 1])) {  // If it's the last character or followed by an operator
                void *p = malloc(sizeof(char));  // Allocate memory
                add[x] = p;  // Store the address
                d[x] = c;    // Store the symbol
                printf("%c\t%p\tidentifier\n", c, p);  // Print symbol and its address
                x++;         // Move to next entry in the table
            }
        }
    }

    // Search for a symbol in the symbol table
    printf("\nThe symbol to be searched: ");
    getchar();  // To consume any leftover newline character
    srch = getchar();

    for (i = 0; i < x; i++) {
        if (srch == d[i]) {  // If symbol matches
            printf("Symbol Found\n");
            printf("%c @ address %p\n", srch, add[i]);
            flag = 1;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (flag == 0) {
        printf("Symbol Not Found\n");
    }

    // Free dynamically allocated memory
    for (i = 0; i < x; i++) {
        free(add[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}

```
